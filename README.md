Hey there!
I am a learning dev trying to code only to work upon my problem solving skills. Programming makes my brain work around problems and find intuitive solutions for them.
I mainly code in python however I also know a little about UI/UX, Web Design and User Experience.
I also do typography, photography and idea generation for fun.
